# X-Team 59 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
 - Chat through Slack App and discuss on the task assignment.
 - Every team member is responsible for finding a substitute in the team when he/she cannot finish the tasks due to personal reasons.
 - Communication is the key.
## How we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
- Each team member shall do a periodical report about the progress of his/her individual tasks
## How we will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
 - Message on slack and communicate about the problem
## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
